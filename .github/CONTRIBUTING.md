# Contributing to fastgen
We release fastgen as-is as a one-time drop and hope it will be
useful to the community. However, we presently do not wish to make
any guarantees on the level of support or maintenance for the code
released.

## Issues
Issues may be opened to flag functional or performance bugs,
preferably in the core inference logic. Tools released with
the library are here for demonstration purposes only and, as
such, will not be actively maintained or improved.

We will provide our best effort to fix correctness bugs, but
we will prioritize fixes at our discretion.

Multi-modal models support is not in our immediate scope.

## Pull Requests
We welcome bug fixes and targeted improvements to the tools.
You may open pull requests to propose changes.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Test your changes and report the results in your PR.
4. Check that previous use cases still work and report in your PR.
5. Make sure your code passes the pre-commit checks.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

Changes to the main inference logic will be subject to stricter
quality constraints as they may affect internal users.

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You
only need to do this once to work on any of Meta's open source projects.
